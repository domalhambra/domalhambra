# Hi, I'm Dom Alhambra

I work in outdoor recreation, wildland firefighting, and land conservation. 
I'm passionate about making technology work for people and natural ecosystems.
I am not a software developer or programmer, just a writer and field worker.

Right now, I'm trying to create an easily portable crypto donation tracker site
so crypto communities can be encouraged to pitch in funds for land conservation
projects that will help empower local communities to flourish.

Contact me on Twitter or email if you'd like to help, because I need all the
help I can get.
